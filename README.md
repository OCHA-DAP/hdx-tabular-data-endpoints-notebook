# HDX Datastore API Python Quickstart

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to interact with the [HDX Datastore API](https://data.humdata.org) using Python. It is a simple hands-on guide for testing queries, exploring data, and learning how to programmatically access tabular resources on HDX. This can be used as inspiration for how to incorporate HDX data resources in your own workflows.

For more information, please refer to our documentation or reach out.
